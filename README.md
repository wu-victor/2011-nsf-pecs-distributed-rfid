Large-scale Distributed RFID Infrastructures for Pervasive Computing

## Abstract

The future of large-scale pervasive computing undoubtedly involves a plethora of devices with various form factors and functionalities, interacting on many levels in concert. In this paper, we argue that simple devices like passive UHF RFID tags, will nonetheless have significant impact in pervasive computing. We provide our vision of a simple, distributed, and scalable infrastructure, and a sampling of application domains. We provide technical challenges that we believe are practical and within our grasp. Finally, we argue why this RFID vision will continue to advance pervasive computing as a whole.
